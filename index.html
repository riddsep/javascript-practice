        Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most
        striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim,
        and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater.

        More importantly, otters are glorious water dogs, playful and curious.
        The otter, no other, is the best animal.
